## Generated Prompts (Cleaned)

### Concept 1: "a cyberpunk street market at night"

**Qwen3-8B:**
```
A hyper-detailed cyberpunk street market at night, rendered in ultra-high resolution (8K), with a dynamic composition featuring a winding, rain-slicked pavement leading through a labyrinth of neon-lit stalls. The scene is dominated by towering holographic advertisements projecting iridescent gradients of electric blue, magenta, and toxic green, casting kaleidoscopic reflections on wet concrete. Neon signage in jagged, retro-futuristic fonts glows with a soft amber hue, while flickering LED strips along metal awnings create a pulsating rhythm of light. In the foreground, a mix of human vendors and robotic arms sell glowing vials of neon liquid, holographic snacks, and cybernetic accessories, with crowds of night-shift workers and augmented reality users weaving through the chaos. The atmosphere is dense with smog and artificial haze, diffusing the light into a surreal, moody glow, while distant skyscrapers pierce the sky, their windows glowing like a thousand tiny suns. Colors are vivid and contrasting: neon pinks and cyans clash with the deep blacks of the night, while metallic silver and chrome accents reflect the ambient light. The lighting is dramatic, with sharp shadows cast by overhead signs and a low-angle spotlight illuminating a central kiosk selling 'memory chips,' its glass surface rippling with digital static. Technical qualities include intricate textures on metallic surfaces, wet pavement with visible water droplets, and a shallow depth of field to emphasize the bustling foreground while blurring the chaotic background. The overall mood is chaotic yet vibrant, blending surrealism with gritty realism, evoking a sense of both wonder and urban decay.
```

**DeepSeek-R1-8B:**
```
Create a vivid and dynamic cyberpunk-themed scene of a bustling street market at night. The composition should capture the energy and dystopian essence of the environment, with neon lights casting vibrant hues across the scene. The scene should be filled with a mix of futuristic and run-down architecture, showcasing the contrast between advanced technology and decay.

The lighting should primarily be dominated by neon glow and holographic advertisements, with secondary illumination from floating street lamps and hovercars. The colors should be predominantly cool tones like cyan, blue, and green, with highlights of bright neon pink and yellow to emphasize the cyberpunk vibe. The atmosphere should feel thick with the hum of hovercars, the flicker of neon signs, and the faint buzz of vendors. 

The market should be alive with activity, featuring vendors with glowing signs and holographic displays. The scene should have a sense of movement, with people navigating through the crowd, some carrying items or glowing devices. The background should include a mix of tall, metallic structures and smaller, more cramped stalls, adding to the urban feel.

The technical quality should be high, with sharp details on the neon signs and holographic projections. The textures of the metallic street surfaces and the holographic overlays should be visible, adding depth to the scene. The sky should be hazy, with a smog-like quality, emphasizing the cyberpunk setting.

Overall, the image should capture the excitement and energy of the market while maintaining a sense of unease and dystopia, blending the vibrant colors of neon with the grime of a run-down urban environment.

### Concept 2: "portrait of an elderly wizard"

**Qwen3-8B:**
```
A high-resolution portrait of an elderly wizard, centered in the frame with a mystical atmosphere, featuring a detailed composition that balances the subject against a softly textured background. The wizard sits in a dimly lit study, his weathered face illuminated by the warm glow of a single, flickering candle on a carved wooden desk, casting long, dramatic shadows across the room. His deep, furrowed skin is rendered with lifelike texture, emphasizing age and wisdom, while his piercing blue eyes glow with an otherworldly light. He wears a long, tattered robe in deep midnight blue, adorned with golden runes and intricate embroidery, and a pointed hat decorated with a silver crescent moon. A large, ancient book lies open beside him, its pages filled with glowing, flowing script, and a staff rests nearby, its wooden surface etched with magical symbols. The lighting is soft and ethereal, with the candlelight creating a warm, golden halo around the wizard’s head and subtle highlights on his hands, which clutch a faded parchment. The background features faint, floating particles of light and a faint mist that swirls around the edges of the frame, enhancing the sense of mystery. Colors are rich and saturated: the wizard’s robes in deep blues and purples contrast with the warm amber of the candlelight, while the background blends cool grays and soft lavenders. The atmosphere is enchanting, with a faint glow emanating from the book and staff, suggesting latent magic. Technical qualities include ultra-high detail (8K resolution), sharp focus on the wizard’s face and hands, smooth gradients in the lighting, and a slight depth-of-field blur on the background elements to emphasize the subject. The overall style is photorealistic with a touch of digital artistry, capturing both the realism of the wizard’s features and the surreal, magical ambiance of the scene.

**DeepSeek-R1-8B:**
```
Create a fantasy-themed portrait of an elderly wizard, capturing a contemplative and wise mood. The wizard is seated in a serene setting, with an open spellbook on his lap and a glowing crystal in his hand. The background features a magical forest with glowing leaves and roots, creating a mystical atmosphere. The lighting is a blend of soft ambient light from the spellbook and a bright glow from the crystal, casting highlights and shadows for depth. The wizard's attire is in deep, rich colors—sapphire blue and gold—with subtle silver threads, reflecting his magical essence. The background uses earthy tones like greens and purples, with some metallic accents. Technical details include intricate patterns on the staff and spellbook, glowing threads in the wizard's clothes, and fine, flowing hair with a twinkle in

### Concept 3: "abandoned space station interior"

**Qwen3-8B:**
```
A highly detailed, photorealistic interior of an abandoned space station, rendered in 8K resolution with cinematic lighting and textures. The composition features a vast, dimly lit main corridor with rusted metallic panels, flickering overhead lights, and scattered debris such as broken consoles, scattered wires, and cracked holographic displays. The corridor leads to a control room with a shattered viewport revealing a star-filled void, a cluster of obsolete control panels with glowing amber indicators, and a malfunctioning hologram projecting static. In the background, a maintenance area showcases exposed piping, tangled cables, and a partially collapsed ceiling, with dust motes suspended in the air. The lighting is characterized by cold, blue ambient glows from dead batteries and faint greenish hues from leaking coolant, contrasting with deep shadows and faint red emergency lights flickering intermittently. Colors are dominated by muted grays, slate blues, and rust-red corrosion, with occasional splashes of neon teal from damaged circuits. The atmosphere exudes isolation, decay, and a sense of lingering mystery, with subtle details like a frozen droplet on a metal surface, a faint hum of static, and the distant echo of a failing ventilation fan. Technical qualities include ultra-detailed textures on metallic surfaces, realistic wear and tear, accurate lighting reflections, and a depth of field focusing on the central corridor while softly blurring distant elements. Style: photorealistic with hyper-detailed environments, emphasizing contrast between light and shadow to enhance the eerie, desolate ambiance.
```

**DeepSeek-R1-8B:**
```
Abandoned space station interior, futuristic technology style. Composition: A cylindrical or ring-shaped structure with exposed beams, pipes, and catwalks. Lighting: Dimly lit with flickering emergency lights, neon signs, and glowing holographic panels. Colors: Cool tones of blue, green, and purple dominate the walls, with glowing elements of bright blue or green highlighting key areas.
