Make sure to use descriptive language and cover all aspects mentioned.\n\nOkay, I need to create a detailed image prompt for a cyberpunk street market at night. The user provided a style reference, so I should start by understanding that. They mentioned neon lights, high technology, and urban dystopia. I need to include composition, lighting, colors, atmosphere, and technical qualities.\n\nFirst, the composition. I should imagine the setting. Maybe a bustling scene with stalls and people. The market should feel alive but also a bit run-down, showing the dystopian aspect. I'll include varied architecture\u2014maybe some structures are old, others futuristic, showing the contrast. Vendors with neon signs and holographic advertisements will add to the cyberpunk vibe.\n\nNext, lighting. It's night, so primary light sources would be neon and holographic signs. Secondary lighting could come from street lamps or hovercars. The lighting should be vibrant but also create shadows that add depth. Glowing liquids or energy drinks might add a bluish tint to the environment.\n\nColors are crucial in cyberpunk. Neon colors like pink, cyan, blue, and green should be prominent. The primary colors would be cooler tones, but highlights can be brighter. The atmosphere should feel a bit gritty but also have a sense of movement and energy.\n\nThe atmosphere should be thick with the hum of hovercars, the buzz of neon signs, and maybe the smell of food or the metallic tang of the environment. The mood should be a mix of excitement and unease, showing the dystopian undercurrent.\n\nTechnical qualities: The image should have sharp details, especially on the neon signs and holograms. Textures like metallic street surfaces or holographic overlays will add depth. The sky should be hazy or filled with smog, emphasizing the cyberpunk feel.\n\nI should make sure all these elements are included in the prompt, using descriptive language. I'll structure it into a coherent paragraph, ensuring each aspect is covered without making it too verbose. Let me organize my thoughts step by step to cover everything comprehensively.\n</think>\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nCreate a vivid and dynamic cyberpunk-themed scene of a bustling street market at night. The composition should capture the energy and dystopian essence of the environment, with neon lights casting vibrant hues across the scene. The scene should be filled with a mix of futuristic and run-down architecture, showcasing the contrast between advanced technology and decay.\n\nThe lighting should primarily be dominated by neon glow and holographic advertisements, with secondary illumination from floating street lamps and hovercars. The colors should be predominantly cool tones like cyan, blue, and green, with highlights of bright neon pink and yellow to emphasize the cyberpunk vibe. The atmosphere should feel thick with the hum of hovercars, the flicker of neon signs, and the faint buzz of vendors. \n\nThe market should be alive with activity, featuring vendors with glowing signs and holographic displays. The scene should have a sense of movement, with people navigating through the crowd, some carrying items or glowing devices. The background should include a mix of tall, metallic structures and smaller, more cramped stalls, adding to the urban feel.\n\nThe technical quality should be high, with sharp details on the neon signs and holographic projections. The textures of the metallic street surfaces and the holographic overlays should be visible, adding depth to the scene. The sky should be hazy, with a smog-like quality, emphasizing the cyberpunk setting.\n\nOverall, the image should capture the excitement and energy of the market while maintaining a sense of unease and dystopia, blending the vibrant colors of neon with the grime of a run-down urban environment.\n</think>"

    "prompt": "<think>\nCreate a detailed image generation prompt based on this description: \"portrait of an elderly wizard\"\nStyle reference: Create a fantasy-themed illustration with magical elements\nInclude specific details about:\n- Composition\n- Lighting\n- Colors\n- Atmosphere\n- Technical qualities\nFormat the response as a single, detailed prompt. Make sure it's clear and concise.\n\nAlright, so I need to create a detailed image generation prompt for a portrait of an elderly wizard. The style reference is a fantasy-themed illustration with magical elements. I should include composition, lighting, colors, atmosphere, and technical qualities.\n\nFirst, let me break down each component.\n\nComposition: The subject is an elderly wizard. So, I should consider how to position him. Maybe in a landscape that reflects his magical environment. Perhaps sitting in a circle of light, surrounded by books or magical elements. Maybe an open book with a spell or a glowing orb in the background. Maybe an ornate staff or a glowing crystal in his hand. Maybe a spellbook on his lap or a magical tree behind him. The composition should be balanced, not cluttered.\n\nLighting: Since it's a fantasy scene, maybe magical lighting. Moonlight filtering through a window or a spell circle casting an inner glow. Maybe the light source is from a magical artifact like a glowing orb or a staff. The lighting should create a warm, inviting atmosphere, but also have some mystical elements, like a soft glow or shimmering effects.\n\nColors: Fantasy colors\u2014rich, vibrant, but also muted for an old, wise wizard. Maybe deep blues, greens, golds, and some warm oranges or reds for magical elements. Maybe the background has cooler tones like purples and indigos to give a mystical feel. The wizard's clothing could be in earthy tones like browns, greens, and deep reds, with some metallic accents for his robes or staff.\n\nAtmosphere: The scene should feel wise and mysterious. Maybe a quiet, contemplative mood. Perhaps there's a gentle breeze or the sound of a river nearby. The atmosphere should be magical but not chaotic. Maybe some mist or floating particles in the air, adding to the mystical vibe. The wizard should seem at peace, maybe with a serene expression.\n\nTechnical qualities: The illustration should have fine details, like intricate patterns in the staff or spellbook. The wizard's face should have a wise look, with maybe a twinkle in his eye. The background should be detailed but not overpowering. Maybe some subtle reflections or glows on objects. The overall image should be cohesive, with all elements blending together smoothly.\n\nPutting it all together, I need to make sure each part is addressed in the prompt. Maybe start with the subject, then the setting, lighting, colors, atmosphere, and technical aspects. Keep the language clear and concise, ensuring that all details are included without being too wordy.\n\nWait, I should also consider the pose of the wizard. Maybe he's sitting in a comfortable chair, with a book open on his lap. Maybe holding a staff with a glowing crystal. The background could have a magical forest with trees that have glowing leaves or roots that seem alive. Maybe some floating spells or magical particles in the air.\n\nLighting could be a combination of soft ambient light from a spellbook and a brighter light from the glowing crystal in his hand. This would create highlights and shadows that add depth to the scene. Maybe some refraction effects in the light where the crystal's glow passes through the air.\n\nColors: The wizard's robes could be in deep, rich colors like sapphire blue and gold, with subtle silver threads. His skin might have a healthy, wise look, with perhaps some age lines but still vibrant. The background could have greens, purples, and a touch of gold where the light hits.\n\nAtmosphere: The overall mood is contemplative and wise. Maybe the wizard is looking into the distance with a faraway look, as if he's communing with spirits or nature. The background elements should support this, like a gentle breeze moving the pages of the spellbook or the glow of a magical tree.\n\nTechnical qualities: The illustration should have fine details, like intricate patterns on the staff and spellbook. Maybe some glowing threads in the wizard's clothes where magical energy flows. The background should have detailed leaves and maybe some dew drops on the grass or plants, adding to the mystical feel.\n\nI think that covers all the aspects. Now, I need to translate this into a clear, concise prompt.\n</think>\n\n**Prompt for Image Generation:**\n\n\"Create a fantasy-themed portrait of an elderly wizard, capturing a contemplative and wise mood.

    "prompt": "<think>\nCreate a detailed image generation prompt based on this description: \"abandoned space station interior\"\nStyle reference: Generate a science fiction scene with futuristic technology\nInclude specific details about:\n- Composition\n- Lighting\n- Colors\n- Atmosphere\n- Technical qualities\nFormat the response as a single, detailed prompt. Make sure it is clear and concise.\n\nAlright, so the user wants me to create a detailed image generation prompt for an abandoned space station interior. The style is science fiction with futuristic technology. Hmm, I need to include composition, lighting, colors, atmosphere, and technical qualities. \n\nFirst, the composition. I should think about how the space station is laid out. Maybe it's in a circular or cylindrical shape, with different levels or rings. That could add depth. I should include some structural elements like exposed beams or pipes, maybe some catwalks. Also, adding some debris or rust can show it's been abandoned for a while.\n\nNext, lighting. Since it's a space station, maybe it's dimly lit with flickering lights or emergency systems. Neon signs could add a futuristic touch. Maybe some areas are illuminated while others are shadowy, creating a moody atmosphere. I should also consider light sources like holographic panels or control screens that might emit light.\n\nColors are important for the mood. I'll use cool tones like blues, greens, and purples for the walls and lighting. Maybe some bright, glowing elements like blue or green to highlight certain areas. The debris could have a rusty, reddish hue to contrast with the futuristic elements.\n\nAtmosphere-wise, it should feel desolate and eerie. Maybe some wind blowing through the station, moving papers or knocking things around. The air should feel thin or stale, giving it a breathable but slightly unpleasant vibe. The sounds could be minimal, like creaking metal or distant alarms to add to the tension.\n\nTechnical qualities should focus on the details. I should include things like exposed wiring, circuit boards, and other tech elements. Maybe some holographic projections or interactive panels that don't work anymore. Adding some damage or wear, like scuffed floors or broken equipment, can emphasize the abandonment. \n\nI also want to make sure the prompt is clear and concise, covering all aspects without being too vague. Each element should be described in a way that guides the generation towards the desired scene. I need to balance being detailed with not overwhelming the user with too much information.\n\nPutting it all together, the prompt should paint a vivid picture of a neglected, futuristic space station, rich in technical and atmospheric elements. I should structure it in a way that flows naturally, ensuring each aspect is covered without repetition.\n</think>\n\n\"Abandoned space station interior, futuristic technology style. Composition: A cylindrical or ring-shaped structure with exposed beams, pipes, and catwalks. Lighting: Dimly lit with flickering emergency lights, neon signs, and glowing holographic panels. Colors: Cool tones of blue, green, and purple dominate the walls, with glowing elements of bright blue or green highlighting key areas. Atmosphere: Desolate and eerie, with a thin, stale air, creaking metal, and minimal ambient sounds. Technical qualities: Exposed wiring, circuit boards, and interactive panels, some with holographic projections. Debris and rust accumulate in corners, with scattered papers and broken equipment. Overall mood: A haunting blend of advanced technology and neglect, with a sense of time passing in a forgotten frontier.\"\n</think>"
