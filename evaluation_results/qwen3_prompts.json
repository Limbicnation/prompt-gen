    "prompt": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants a detailed Stable Diffusion prompt for a cyberpunk street market at night. Let me start by breaking down the components they mentioned: composition, lighting, colors, atmosphere, and technical qualities. \n\nFirst, composition. A street market at night should have a dynamic layout. Maybe a winding path with stalls on both sides. Including elements like neon signs, holograms, and maybe some drones or robots. Also, perspective is important\u2014maybe a wide-angle shot to show depth.\n\nLighting is crucial in cyberpunk. Neon lights, glowing signs, maybe some light pollution from the city. Think about how the light interacts with the environment\u2014reflective surfaces, shadows. Maybe some areas are brightly lit while others are darker, creating contrast.\n\nColors should be vibrant and contrasting. Neon pinks, blues, greens, with some metallic accents. Darker tones for the background to make the neon stand out. Maybe some color bleeding from the lights.\n\nAtmosphere needs to feel bustling yet chaotic. People moving around, maybe some action like a robot arm selling something. Smog or haze to add to the cyberpunk vibe. Sounds might be implied through visual elements, like vibrations or light flickers.\n\nTechnical qualities: High resolution, maybe 8K for detail. Focus on textures\u2014metallic surfaces, glowing signs, wet pavement. Depth of field to keep the foreground sharp and background slightly blurred. Maybe some lens flares from the neon lights.\n\nWait, should I mention specific elements like vendors? Maybe include a mix of human and robotic vendors. Also, think about the time of night\u2014maybe it's midnight with a full moon? Or maybe the city lights are so bright that the moon isn't visible. \n\nNeed to make sure all the elements are included and flow well. Let me structure the prompt with each section, ensuring it's a single, cohesive description. Avoid being too vague. Use specific terms like \"neon signage,\" \"holographic advertisements,\" \"rain-slicked pavement.\" Also, mention the mood\u2014surreal, chaotic, vibrant. \n\nCheck if technical qualities like aspect ratio or style are needed. The user didn't specify, but maybe include something like \"ultra-high resolution\" or \"detailed textures.\" Also, maybe mention the camera angle, like a low-angle shot to emphasize the towering structures. \n\nOkay, putting it all together now. Make sure each part is covered and the prompt is detailed enough for Stable Diffusion to generate the image accurately.\n...done thinking.\n\n**Stable Diffusion Prompt:**  \n\"A hyper-detailed cyberpunk street market at night, rendered in ultra-high resolution (8K), with a dynamic composition featuring a winding, rain-slicked pavement leading through a labyrinth of neon-lit stalls. The scene is dominated by towering holographic advertisements projecting iridescent gradients of electric blue, magenta, and toxic green, casting kaleidoscopic reflections on wet concrete. Neon signage in jagged, retro-futuristic fonts glows with a soft amber hue, while flickering LED strips along metal awnings create a pulsating rhythm of light. In the foreground, a mix of human vendors and robotic arms sell glowing vials of neon liquid, holographic snacks, and cybernetic accessories, with crowds of night-shift workers and augmented reality users weaving through the chaos. The atmosphere is dense with smog and artificial haze, diffusing the light into a surreal, moody glow, while distant skyscrapers pierce the sky, their windows glowing like a thousand tiny suns. Colors are vivid and contrasting: neon pinks and cyans clash with the deep blacks of the night, while metallic silver and chrome accents reflect the ambient light. The lighting is dramatic, with sharp shadows cast by overhead signs and a low-angle spotlight illuminating a central kiosk selling 'memory chips,' its glass surface rippling with digital static. Technical qualities include intricate textures on metallic surfaces, wet pavement with visible water droplets, and a shallow depth of field to emphasize the bustling foreground while blurring the chaotic background. The overall mood is chaotic yet vibrant, blending surrealism with gritty realism, evoking a sense of both wonder and urban decay.\"",

    "prompt": "Thinking...\nOkay, I need to create a detailed Stable Diffusion prompt for a portrait of an elderly wizard. Let me start by recalling the user's requirements. They want specific details on composition, lighting, colors, atmosphere, and technical qualities, all in one prompt.\n\nFirst, composition. The user probably wants a balanced and engaging layout. Maybe the wizard is centered, with some elements around him. Maybe a book or a staff? Also, the background should complement without distracting. Maybe a library or a mystical place?\n\nLighting is important. Soft lighting to give a warm, mystical feel. Maybe a single light source, like a window or a magical glow. Highlighting the wizard's face and hands to show detail. Maybe some light rays or magical effects?\n\nColors. Warm tones for the wizard's robes, maybe deep reds or purples. The background could have cooler tones to contrast. Accents like gold or silver for magical elements. Maybe some glowing elements in the background?\n\nAtmosphere should be mystical and enchanting. Maybe some floating particles, a faint mist, or glowing runes. The air could feel thick with magic, with subtle effects like light beams or faint smoke.\n\nTechnical qualities: High resolution, detailed textures. Maybe 8K for clarity. Sharp focus on the wizard's face and hands, with some depth of field for the background. Realistic skin textures, maybe some wrinkles to show age. Accurate lighting and shadows to enhance the mood.\n\nWait, I should make sure all these elements are included. Let me structure each section. Start with composition, then lighting, colors, atmosphere, technical qualities. Use specific adjectives. Avoid being too vague. Maybe mention the wizard's appearance: long beard, glasses, etc. Also, the setting: maybe a study or a magical forest?\n\nCheck if I missed any details. The user might want the wizard to have a certain expression, like wise or mysterious. Maybe include elements like a magical staff or a book open on a table. The atmosphere could have a slight glow or ethereal quality. Technical aspects like resolution, style (realistic, digital art), and maybe some specific effects like bokeh or lens flares.\n\nPutting it all together into a coherent prompt. Make sure it's a single, detailed prompt without markdown. Use commas and semicolons to separate the elements. Avoid repetition. Ensure each section is covered with specific terms. Maybe start with the subject, then composition, lighting, colors, atmosphere, technical qualities. Alright, let me draft that.\n...done thinking.\n\nA high-resolution portrait of an elderly wizard, centered in the frame with a mystical atmosphere, featuring a detailed composition that balances the subject against a softly textured background. The wizard sits in a dimly lit study, his weathered face illuminated by the warm glow of a single, flickering candle on a carved wooden desk, casting long, dramatic shadows across the room. His deep, furrowed skin is rendered with lifelike texture, emphasizing age and wisdom, while his piercing blue eyes glow with an otherworldly light. He wears a long, tattered robe in deep midnight blue, adorned with golden runes and intricate embroidery, and a pointed hat decorated with a silver crescent moon. A large, ancient book lies open beside him, its pages filled with glowing, flowing script, and a staff rests nearby, its wooden surface etched with magical symbols. The lighting is soft and ethereal, with the candlelight creating a warm, golden halo around the wizard\u2019s head and subtle highlights on his hands, which clutch a faded parchment. The background features faint, floating particles of light and a faint mist that swirls around the edges of the frame, enhancing the sense of mystery. Colors are rich and saturated: the wizard\u2019s robes in deep blues and purples contrast with the warm amber of the candlelight, while the background blends cool grays and soft lavenders. The atmosphere is enchanting, with a faint glow emanating from the book and staff, suggesting latent magic. Technical qualities include ultra-high detail (8K resolution), sharp focus on the wizard\u2019s face and hands, smooth gradients in the lighting, and a slight depth-of-field blur on the background elements to emphasize the subject. The overall style is photorealistic with a touch of digital artistry, capturing both the realism of the wizard\u2019s features and the surreal, magical ambiance of the scene.",

    "prompt": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user wants a detailed Stable Diffusion prompt for an abandoned space station interior. Let me start by breaking down the components they mentioned: composition, lighting, colors, atmosphere, and technical qualities. \n\nFirst, composition. They probably want a realistic scene with various elements like corridors, control rooms, maybe some machinery. I should mention different areas to add depth, like a main corridor with flickering lights, a control room with consoles, and a maintenance area with pipes. Including details like rusted panels and debris will make it feel abandoned.\n\nLighting is next. Since it's abandoned, maybe use dim lighting. Flickering lights could create an eerie vibe. Maybe some light sources like broken overhead panels, glowing wires, and shadows. Also, consider natural light from a window, but since it's a space station, maybe it's a viewport showing stars or darkness. \n\nColors should be muted. Think grays, blues, and dark tones. Accents like rust red or green for corrosion. Maybe some glowing elements in teal or cyan to add interest without overpowering the scene.\n\nAtmosphere needs to feel eerie and desolate. Maybe include elements like dust motes in the air, a sense of silence, and maybe some subtle movement like a fan spinning or a distant hum. The atmosphere should make the viewer feel isolated and tense.\n\nTechnical qualities: High resolution, 8K, detailed textures. Mention specific aspects like metallic surfaces, wear and tear, and lighting effects. Maybe include depth of field to focus on certain areas. Also, specify the style as photorealistic with cinematic lighting.\n\nWait, the user wants all these details in a single prompt. Let me structure it step by step. Start with the main subject, then composition elements, lighting, colors, atmosphere, and technical specs. Make sure to include all the specifics they asked for. Avoid being too vague. Use adjectives that convey the right mood and details. Check if I missed any elements. Maybe add some specific objects like a broken hologram or a malfunctioning robot to enhance the abandoned feel. Also, ensure the prompt flows well and is comprehensive enough for Stable Diffusion to generate a detailed image.\n...done thinking.\n\n**Prompt:**  \nA highly detailed, photorealistic interior of an abandoned space station, rendered in 8K resolution with cinematic lighting and textures. The composition features a vast, dimly lit main corridor with rusted metallic panels, flickering overhead lights, and scattered debris such as broken consoles, scattered wires, and cracked holographic displays. The corridor leads to a control room with a shattered viewport revealing a star-filled void, a cluster of obsolete control panels with glowing amber indicators, and a malfunctioning hologram projecting static. In the background, a maintenance area showcases exposed piping, tangled cables, and a partially collapsed ceiling, with dust motes suspended in the air. The lighting is characterized by cold, blue ambient glows from dead batteries and faint greenish hues from leaking coolant, contrasting with deep shadows and faint red emergency lights flickering intermittently. Colors are dominated by muted grays, slate blues, and rust-red corrosion, with occasional splashes of neon teal from damaged circuits. The atmosphere exudes isolation, decay, and a sense of lingering mystery, with subtle details like a frozen droplet on a metal surface, a faint hum of static, and the distant echo of a failing ventilation fan. Technical qualities include ultra-detailed textures on metallic surfaces, realistic wear and tear, accurate lighting reflections, and a depth of field focusing on the central corridor while softly blurring distant elements. Style: photorealistic with hyper-detailed environments, emphasizing contrast between light and shadow to enhance the eerie, desolate ambiance.",
